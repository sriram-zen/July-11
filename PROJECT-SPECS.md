## **Product Concept** 

A digital platform for Indian trusts/NGOs that automates donation management, receipt generation, compliance workflows, and communication. The platform will prioritize compliance automation, pilot WhatsApp PDF receipt automation with fallback to email/SMS, adopt a mobile-first, regionally localized interface, and implement robust fallback/error-handling for all automated workflows. Ongoing regulatory monitoring and legal review will ensure compliance and adaptability.
